GEOS 64 2.0
Desktop Disassembly

This is a work in progress to disassemble and comment the GEOS 64 desktop.  It consists of 6 VLIR records.  

The build.bat file a DOS batch file, and assumes gcc is installed (to compile the createcvt application).  Running build.bat will recompile the code, and execute the createcvt program to generate a byte-exact build of the desktop application.
